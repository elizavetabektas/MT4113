# One possible approach would be to do the following:
  
# 1. Use the which() and diff() commands to create a vector of the positions at which a new run of zeros and ones begins.
# Donâ€™t forget position 1.
# 2. Create a second vector that is identical, but has the value length(x)+1 appended to it
# 3. Now determine the lengths of those runs of zeros and ones, using the vector you have just generated as a starting point.
# 4. Identify the locations that are the starts of runs of length  k or greater and take the value of 1. Record their lengths.
# 5. Process the vector of run starts to return multiple values for any run of length greater than k
# 6. Generate a random binary sequence of length 100000 on which to test this
